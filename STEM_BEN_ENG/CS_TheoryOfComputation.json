        "Correct Answer": "The \\(\\epsilon\\)-closure of a state in an NFA affects the construction of the corresponding DFA by determining the set of states that can be reached from a given state by making zero or more \\(\\epsilon\\)-transitions. This set is used to define the start state and the transition function of the DFA. Specifically, the start state of the DFA is the \\(\\epsilon\\)-closure of the start state of the NFA, and the transition function of the DFA is defined based on the \\(\\epsilon\\)-closures of the states reached by the NFA transitions.",

        "Correct Answer": "The set \\(Q' = \\mathcal{P}(Q)\\) represents the power set of the set of states \\(Q\\) of the NFA. In the context of converting an NFA to a DFA, \\(Q'\\) is significant because each state of the DFA corresponds to a subset of states of the NFA. This allows the DFA to simulate the behavior of the NFA by keeping track of all possible states the NFA could be in after reading each input symbol.",

For each state \\(R\\) in the DFA and each input symbol \\(a\\), \\(\\delta'(R, a)\\) is defined as the union of the \\(\\epsilon\\)-closures of the states reached by the NFA transitions from any state in \\(R\\) on input \\(a\\).

If a language does not have this property, then it must be nonregular.

Since there are no other symbols to process, the automaton will then pop the top symbol S from the stack and stay in state q'.

By specifying the transitions based on the current state, input symbol, and top stack symbol, δ allows the pushdown automaton to simulate the derivation steps of a context-free grammar, thereby accepting the same language as the grammar.",

        "Correct Answer": "The proof of the pumping lemma for context-free languages utilizes the concept of parse trees by considering the derivation of a sufficiently long string in the context-free language. The parse tree for this string will have a height that allows the application of the pigeonhole principle, ensuring that some variable occurs more than once on the longest root-to-leaf path. This repetition allows the string to be 'pumped' by repeating the subtree corresponding to the repeated variable, resulting in a new string that is also in the language.",

        "Correct Answer": "The significance of the Chomsky normal form in the proof of the pumping lemma for context-free languages lies in its structured form, where each production rule is either of the form A → BC or A → a. This form simplifies the analysis of the parse tree by ensuring that each internal node has exactly two children, making it easier to apply the pigeonhole principle and identify the repeated variables needed for the pumping argument.",

        "Question": "Why is it significant that every language in NP is decidable?",
        "Correct Answer": "It is significant that every language in NP is decidable because it ensures that there exists an algorithm to determine membership in these languages. This means that while the problems may be difficult to solve efficiently, they are still solvable in principle, which is crucial for theoretical and practical applications.",

        "Question": "How does the diagram on page 251 illustrate the relationship between regular languages and context-free languages?",
        "Correct Answer": "The diagram on page 251 shows that regular languages are a subset of context-free languages, indicating that every regular language is also a context-free language. This illustrates that context-free languages are more general and can describe a broader range of languages than regular languages.",

        "Correct Answer": "The property that every context-free language is in P places context-free languages within the P class, indicating that they can be decided in polynomial time. This helps in classifying context-free languages as efficiently solvable problems and positions them within the broader hierarchy of language classes.",

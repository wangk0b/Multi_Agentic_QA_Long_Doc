        "Question": "How does the role of a sophisticated user differ from that of an end user in a database system?",
        "Correct Answer": "A sophisticated user uses methods other than the application program to access the database, whereas an end user requires access to a database for querying, updating, and generating reports.",

        "Question": "What are the historical developments that led to the creation of SQL, and how did it evolve over time?",
        "Correct Answer": "SQL was initially developed by IBM in the early 1970s. The initial version, called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's quasi-relational database management system, System R. Then in the late 1970s, Relational Software Inc., which is now Oracle Corporation, introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL, Oracle V2 for VAX computers.",

        "Correct Answer": "The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new database. Once the database is created, the next step is to create tables within the database using the CREATE TABLE statement, which includes specifying the table name, column names, data types, and optional column constraints.",

        "Question": "What are the implications of using different data types such as FLOAT and REAL in SQL, and how do they affect data storage and precision?",
        "Correct Answer": "FLOAT and REAL are both floating-point data types. FLOAT has a larger range and precision compared to REAL. FLOAT can store values from approximately 1.79E-308 to 1.79E+308, while REAL can store values from approximately 3.40E-38 to 3.40E+38.

        "Correct Answer": "The CHECK constraint restricts the values that can be entered into a table by evaluating a boolean expression.

        "Question": "How does the concept of a ternary relationship differ from a binary relationship in terms of database design?",
        "Correct Answer": "A ternary relationship involves many-to-many relationships between three tables, whereas a binary relationship involves relationships between two tables. In a ternary relationship, a new relation is created to represent the relationship, and the primary key of this new relation is a combination of the primary keys of the participating entities that hold the many side.",

        "Correct Answer": "Primary keys uniquely identify each record in a table, ensuring that no duplicate records exist. Foreign keys create a link between tables, enforcing referential integrity by ensuring that a value in one table corresponds to a valid record in another table. Composite keys, which consist of two or more attributes, ensure data integrity by uniquely identifying records based on a combination of attributes.",

        "Question": "How do the different types of relationships (1:M, 1:1, M:N) affect the structure and complexity of a relational database?",
        "Correct Answer": "One-to-many (1:M) relationships are common and straightforward to implement, with one record in a table related to multiple records in another table. One-to-one (1:1) relationships are less common and can indicate that two entities should be combined into a single table. Many-to-many (M:N) relationships are more complex and require the creation of a junction table to manage the relationships between entities.",

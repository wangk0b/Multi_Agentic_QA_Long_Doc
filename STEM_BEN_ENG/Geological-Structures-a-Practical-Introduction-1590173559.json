        "Correct Answer": "Lithostatic stress is the pressure due to overlying rock, not fluid, and is used in geological contexts to describe the stress exerted by the weight of overlying rock layers. Hydrostatic stress, on the other hand, is the pressure exerted by a fluid. The implications for rock deformation include differences in how rocks respond to these stresses, with lithostatic stress being more relevant in deeper geological formations where rock layers exert significant pressure.",

        "Correct Answer": "It is necessary to extrapolate experimental strain rates to geological strain rates because geological strain rates are of the order of \\(10^{-12} - 10^{-15}\\) strains per second, which are much slower than what can be achieved in laboratory experiments. The challenge is that experimental rigs cannot achieve such slow strain rates, so results must be extrapolated to be geologically meaningful.",

        "Correct Answer": "Synthetic Riedel shears (R-shears) have an orientation at about 15° to the main fault plane and display the same sense of shear as the main fault. Antithetic Riedel shears (R'-shears) are developed at about 75° to the fault plane and have a sense of shear opposite to that of the main fault.

        "Correct Answer": "The presence of Brooks Dolomite at both extreme ends of the section provides fixed points for constructing the cross-section. At each fold hinge, an axial trace is constructed that bisects the bedding dips on either side, ensuring the thickness of each unit remains unchanged as it crosses the fold.",

        "Correct Answer": "The principle of original horizontality assists in the relative dating of geological strata by assuming that layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally. This helps in identifying the relative ages of rock layers. However, in complex geological settings where layers have been deformed, tilted, or folded, this principle may not hold true, limiting its applicability.",

        "Question": "How does the concept of effective stress influence the stability of geological structures in different environments, and what are the implications for engineering projects such as dam construction?",
        "Correct Answer": "Effective stress is the overall stress minus the fluid pressure. It influences the stability of geological structures by determining the actual stress acting on the rock framework. In environments with high fluid pressure, effective stress is reduced, potentially leading to instability. For engineering projects like dam construction, understanding effective stress is crucial for ensuring the stability of the foundation and preventing failures.",

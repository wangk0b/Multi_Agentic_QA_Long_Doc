        "Question": "How does the use of JSON simplify the process of data extraction and manipulation in Python compared to XML, and what are the potential limitations of using JSON in certain applications?",
        "Correct Answer": "JSON simplifies the process of data extraction and manipulation in Python because `json.loads()` returns a Python list, which can be traversed with a for loop, and each item within that list is a Python dictionary. This allows the use of native Python structures and operators for data extraction. However, JSON is less self-descriptive than XML, which can be a limitation in applications where more descriptive data structures are needed, such as word processors that store documents using XML.",

        "Question": "How does the concept of Service-oriented architecture (SOA) enhance modularity and reusability in software development, and what are its potential drawbacks in terms of performance and security?",
        "Correct Answer": "SOA enhances modularity and reusability by allowing different applications to interact through APIs, making a set of services available for use by other applications. This modular approach allows for better data management and flexibility in setting rules for data usage. However, potential drawbacks include the need for careful design to ensure good performance and security, as the distributed nature of SOA can introduce performance overhead and security vulnerabilities.",

        "Question": "How does the use of OAuth provide a balance between security and usability in API interactions, and what are the potential challenges in its implementation, particularly in large-scale applications?",
        "Correct Answer": "OAuth provides a balance between security and usability by allowing users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials. This is achieved through the use of tokens. However, implementing OAuth in large-scale applications can be challenging due to the complexity of managing tokens, ensuring secure storage and transmission, and handling the increased number of requests for token validation.",

        "Question": "How does object-oriented programming (OOP) help in managing the complexity of large-scale software projects, and what are the potential challenges in its implementation, especially in terms of performance and maintainability?",
        "Correct Answer": "OOP helps manage complexity by organizing code into classes and objects, allowing for modular design and reuse of code. This makes it easier to understand and maintain large codebases. However, potential challenges include performance overhead due to the abstraction layers and the difficulty of managing complex inheritance hierarchies, which can lead to maintenance issues.",

        "Correct Answer": "BeautifulSoup facilitates web scraping by parsing HTML and XML documents, allowing easy extraction of data using Python. When used with urllib, it can retrieve web pages and parse their content. However, this approach has limitations in handling dynamic content generated by JavaScript, as BeautifulSoup and urllib cannot execute JavaScript, making it difficult to scrape data from such pages.",

        "Correct Answer": "Primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table, while foreign keys create a link between tables by referencing primary keys. This relationship ensures data integrity by enforcing referential constraints. However, managing these relationships in complex schemas can be challenging due to the need for careful design to avoid circular references and ensure efficient query performance.",

However, using JOINs in large databases can lead to performance issues, especially with complex queries, as the database engine needs to process and match large datasets, which can be resource-intensive.",

        "Question": "How does the process of 'random walk programming' hinder effective debugging, and what strategies can be employed to avoid it?",
        "Correct Answer": "The process of 'random walk programming' hinders effective debugging by making random changes to the code until it works, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. To avoid it, one should have at least one hypothesis about the problem and think of a test that would eliminate one of the possibilities.",

        "Question": "What are the potential pitfalls of relying solely on reading your code for debugging, and how can you mitigate these pitfalls?",
        "Correct Answer": "Relying solely on reading your code for debugging can be ineffective if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. You can read the code multiple times and still not see the error. To mitigate this, you should also run experiments, take time to think, and sometimes retreat to a simpler version of the program.",

        "Correct Answer": "Taking a break or explaining the problem to someone else can help in the debugging process because it allows you to see the problem with fresh eyes or from a different perspective. This approach is effective because it can lead to new insights and solutions that were not apparent before.",

        "Question": "Why might beginning programmers be reluctant to retreat when debugging, and what are the benefits of overcoming this reluctance?",
        "Correct Answer": "Beginning programmers might be reluctant to retreat because they can't stand to delete a line of code, even if it's wrong. Overcoming this reluctance can be beneficial because retreating allows you to simplify the program until you get to something that works and that you understand, making it easier to rebuild and fix the problem.",

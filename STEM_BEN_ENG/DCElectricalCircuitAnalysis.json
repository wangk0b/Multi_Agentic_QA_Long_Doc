        "Correct Answer": "The concept of a supermesh simplifies the analysis by combining the two mesh loops that contain the current source I_s into a single supermesh loop. This avoids the need to directly include the current source in the KVL equations. The resulting equations are: ∑ V_rises = ∑ V_drops E_1 = V_R1 + V_R2 + E_2 Expanding using Ohm's law: E_1 - E_2 = I_1 R_1 + I_2 R_2 By inspection: I_s = I_1 - I_2 or I_2 = I_1 - I_s Substituting and solving for I_1 and I_2: 20V - 12V = 5Ω I_1 + 8Ω I_2 8V = 5Ω I_1 + 8Ω I_2 I_1 ≈ 1.231A I_2 = I_1 - I_s ≈ 1.769A V_b = 20V - I_1 5Ω ≈ 26.15V",

This work was expanded later in the nineteenth century by Gustav Kirchhoff, James Clerk Maxwell, Léon Charles Thévenin, and others. The late 1800s and early 1900s saw the practical application of electrical theory to solve practical problems, with notable figures like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla.

For example, 360 can be written as 3.6 times 100, or 3.6 × 10². Engineering notation is similar but the exponent must be a multiple of three.

Significant digits represent the accuracy in measurement or computation. For example, weighing a 156-pound adult versus a small child of 23 pounds with a scale that only resolves to one pound presents an uncertainty of one pound.

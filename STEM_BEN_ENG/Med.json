        "Question": "How does the principle of overload apply to both aerobic and resistance training?",
        "Correct Answer": "The principle of overload applies to both aerobic and resistance training by suggesting that the amount of stress applied during exercise must exceed a threshold level to stimulate adaptation. For aerobic training, this could mean increasing the duration or intensity of cardiovascular activities. For resistance training, it involves progressively increasing the weight or resistance used in exercises.",

        "Correct Answer": "The principle of reversibility affects the benefits gained from chronic aerobic exercise by indicating that the adaptations and improvements in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems can be lost over time if training is modified or stopped. This means that the benefits of consistent aerobic exercise, such as improved heart rate and pulmonary adaptations, will diminish if the exercise routine is not maintained.",

        "Question": "How does the all-or-nothing principle affect muscle fiber recruitment during exercise?",
        "Correct Answer": "The all-or-nothing principle affects muscle fiber recruitment during exercise by stating that muscle fibers either contract maximally along their length or not at all. When stimulated, muscle fibers contract to their maximum level, and the force generated by a muscle is due to the number of muscle fibers recruited to contract. This principle ensures that when lifting heavier weights, more muscle fibers are recruited to achieve the required force.",

They are suited for endurance activities. Type II muscle fibers, also known as fast-twitch or low-oxidative muscle fibers, are larger, have a decreased blood supply, contract more rapidly, and are more adapted to produce energy anaerobically. They are suited for short-duration, high-intensity activities.",

For example, a lack of parental supervision and poor social skills can increase the risk of drug addiction, while positive relationships and parental monitoring can act as protective factors. Similarly, the availability of drugs at school and community poverty can increase the risk of drug addiction, while school anti-drug policies and neighborhood pride can reduce it.",

For example, a person with poor social skills, lack of parental supervision, and exposure to drug-using peers is at a higher risk of drug addiction. Similarly, engaging in risky sexual behaviors and having multiple sexual partners can increase the risk of STDs. The combination of these factors can lead to severe health complications and a higher burden on the individual's overall health.",

Positive relationships can act as protective factors, while negative relationships can increase risk. For example, peer pressure and drug-using friends can lead to drug addiction, while supportive relationships can help prevent it. Similarly, healthy relationships and communication can reduce the risk of STDs. Leveraging these relationships for prevention involves promoting positive social interactions, providing education, and encouraging open communication about risks and prevention strategies.",

        "Correct Answer": "The BMI method fails to account for differences in body composition between males and females because it does not distinguish between fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM). Females naturally have more body fat than males, yet BMI does not account for this difference.",

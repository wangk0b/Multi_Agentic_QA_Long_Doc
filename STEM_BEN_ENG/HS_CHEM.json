        "Question": "If the charge of an electron were twice as large, how would this affect the stability of atoms and the formation of compounds?",
        "Correct Answer": "If the charge of an electron were twice as large, atoms would be less stable because the increased electrostatic attraction between electrons and protons would cause electrons to be held more tightly to the nucleus. This would make it more difficult for atoms to share or transfer electrons, potentially reducing the formation of compounds.",

        "Correct Answer": "The discovery of neutrons by Chadwick resolved the discrepancy in atomic mass observed in Rutherford's model by accounting for the additional mass in the nucleus that was not due to protons. Neutrons, being neutral particles with a mass similar to protons, explained why the atomic mass was greater than the number of protons alone.",

        "Correct Answer": "The concept of isotopes explains the variation in atomic mass for elements with the same atomic number by recognizing that isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

        "Correct Answer": "The periodic law accounts for the recurring properties of elements in the periodic table by stating that when elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, elements with similar properties recur at regular intervals. This is due to the periodic repetition of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of atoms.",

Metals are typically found on the left and center of the table and are characterized by their ability to conduct electricity and heat, malleability, and ductility. Nonmetals are found on the right side and are generally poor conductors with varied states at room temperature. Metalloids, which have properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals, are located along the zigzag line dividing metals and nonmetals.",

When atoms lose electrons, they form positively charged cations, and when they gain electrons, they form negatively charged anions. The electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions leads to the formation of ionic compounds.",

        "Question": "How can the concept of density be applied to determine whether a ring is made of platinum, and what are the limitations of this method?",
        "Correct Answer": "The concept of density can be applied to determine whether a ring is made of platinum by measuring the mass and volume of the ring and calculating its density. The calculated density can then be compared to the known density of platinum. The limitations of this method include the need for precise measurements and the possibility of the ring being made of an alloy with a similar density.",

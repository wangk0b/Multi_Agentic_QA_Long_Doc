        "Question": "How does the use of temporary variables in updating the state of a system help in maintaining the principle of conservation?",
        "Correct Answer": "The use of temporary variables helps in maintaining the principle of conservation by ensuring that the updates to the state variables are done simultaneously. This prevents the issue where one variable is updated using the new value of another variable that has already been updated, which can lead to inconsistencies and violations of the conservation principle.",

        "Question": "What are the potential pitfalls of using the same script name in different folders, and how can it affect debugging?",
        "Correct Answer": "Using the same script name in different folders can lead to confusion about which version of the script is being executed. MATLAB searches for scripts in a sequence of folders called the search path, and if it finds a script with the same name in multiple locations, it might run a different version than the one you intended. This can make debugging difficult because you might be looking at one version of the code while MATLAB is running another.",

        "Correct Answer": "To ensure that the total number of bikes remains constant, you can use temporary variables to update the state of the system. For example:\n```matlab\nb_new = b - 0.05*b + 0.03*c;\nc_new = c + 0.05*b - 0.03*c;\nb = b_new;\nc = c_new;\n```\nThis approach ensures that the updates to `b` and `c` are done simultaneously, maintaining the total number of bikes.",

Test the script to ensure it works correctly. 3. Add more functionality to the script in small increments. 4. Test the script after each addition to ensure it still works correctly. This approach is beneficial because it helps identify and fix errors early, makes the code easier to understand and debug, and ensures that each part of the program works correctly before moving on to the next part.",

        "Question": "How does the inclusion of air resistance affect the simulation of the falling penny problem?",
        "Correct Answer": "The inclusion of air resistance affects the simulation of the falling penny problem by adding a drag force that opposes the motion, reducing the acceleration and resulting in a lower terminal velocity. This makes the simulation more realistic compared to free fall without air resistance.",

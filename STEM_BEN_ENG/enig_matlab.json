        "Question": "How would the stress-strain curve change if the material exhibited plastic deformation after the yield point?",
        "Correct Answer": "The stress-strain curve would show a distinct yield point followed by a region where the stress remains relatively constant or increases slightly with increasing strain, indicating plastic deformation. After this region, the curve would eventually drop off, indicating failure.",

        "Correct Answer": "The key features of MATLAB's graphics capabilities include the ability to visualize engineering and scientific data in 2-D and 3-D plots, interactivity to build graphs and generate command output that can be saved for future use, and the ability to export plots in various file formats (e.g., .jpg, .png) to embed in Microsoft Word documents or PowerPoint slideshows. MATLAB also contains interactive tools to explore and analyze data, such as zooming in on plots to take measurements, performing statistical calculations, fitting curves to data, and evaluating the obtained expression for a desired value.",

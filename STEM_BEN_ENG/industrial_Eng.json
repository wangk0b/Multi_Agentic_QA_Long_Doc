        "Correct Answer": "The identification of value-added (VA) and non-value-added (NVA) activities in a value stream map contributes to waste reduction by categorizing activities based on their value to the customer. VA activities create value as perceived by the customer, while NVA activities do not and should be eliminated immediately. This helps in focusing efforts on eliminating waste, such as time spent in storage or transport, which does not add value to the product.",

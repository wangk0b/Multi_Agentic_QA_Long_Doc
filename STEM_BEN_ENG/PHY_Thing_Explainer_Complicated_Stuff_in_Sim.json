        "Question": "How do 'GREAT CIRCLE STORMS' form and what are their characteristics?",
        "Correct Answer": "'GREAT CIRCLE STORMS' form as a kind of 'low' powered by the heat carried by sea water as it turns to air and rises from the surface when warmed by the Sun. They have very strong winds in a circle near the center, but right in the center it is calm—and can be clear. People call this clear area the 'eye' of the storm. When these storms come in from the sea, they bring rain with them. The winds blow what sea they find ahead of them. They can also make so much wind that they can knock down whole cities. They can also make so much rain that the wind and waves wash away people, cars, and houses.",

        "Question": "How does the 'TREE-EATING FLOWER' affect trees and what is its impact on the ecosystem?",
        "Correct Answer": "The 'TREE-EATING FLOWER' makes holes in trees and steals food and water from inside them. If the flowers get big, they can kill the branches they’re growing on, or even kill the whole tree. When people stand under this flower at a party, other people tell them to kiss.",

        "Question": "How do 'RUN-AWAY FIRES' start and what is their significance in the context of the machine for burning cities?",
        "Correct Answer": "'RUN-AWAY FIRES' start when the heavy center of one of the metal pieces breaks in half, it lets out some of those pieces. If one of these hits another piece, the same thing happens again. Soon there are more and more hot, fast pieces, and the whole thing can become a run-away fire. In the context of the machine for burning cities, these fires are significant because they can make the machine blow up and burn a whole city.",

        "Correct Answer": "'COLD AIR COMING IN' shows where cold air is coming in. This can mean there will be wind, and then flashes of light, sound from the clouds, and very, very heavy rain, but it doesn’t last long. 'WARM AIR COMING IN' means warm air will be moving into an area. This can mean there will be clouds ahead of the warm air, sometimes a few days before it gets there, and rain as it moves in.",

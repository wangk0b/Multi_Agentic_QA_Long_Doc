        "Question": "How did the FAA's certification standards for rain and hail ingestion change after the incidents involving Air Europe, TACA, and Continental Airlines?",
        "Correct Answer": "The FAA initiated rulemaking for new rain and hail ingestion certification standards in August 1996. The new engine certification standard, 14 Code of Federal Regulations Section 33.78, 'Rain and Hail Ingestion,' went into effect on March 26, 1998. This standard requires that all engines be capable of acceptable operation when subjected to sudden encounters with certain specified atmospheric concentrations of rain for 3 continuous minutes and hail for 30 continuous seconds, without experiencing flameout, rundown, continued or nonrecoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability.",

        "Correct Answer": "The Safety Board recommended that the FAA complete the review of the current turbofan engine certification standards for rain and hail ingestion, and, if necessary, revise the standards in consideration of recent service experience and atmospheric data. Additionally, the Safety Board recommended that the FAA require all turbofan engine and turbofan-powered aircraft manufacturers, working with operators of such aircraft, to develop effective operational strategies and related guidance materials to minimize the chance of a dual-engine power loss, and verify that these strategies and guidance materials are incorporated into operating manuals and training programs in a timely fashion.",

        "Question": "What were the FAA's actions following the TACA dual-engine flameout event in 1988?",
        "Correct Answer": "Following the TACA dual-engine flameout event, the FAA issued Telegraphic Airworthiness Directive (AD) T88-11-51 on May 27, 1988, establishing a minimum engine fan speed (N1) of 40 percent when 737 aircraft equipped with CFM56 engines were operated during flight in or near heavy precipitation. This AD was superseded on June 14, 1988, by AD T88-13-51, which raised the minimum N1 limitation to 45 percent.",

        "Question": "How did the flight crew's actions during the engine restart attempts deviate from the Boeing 737 Operations Manual?",
        "Correct Answer": "The flight crew's actions deviated from the Boeing 737 Operations Manual by making three unsuccessful attempts to restart the engines followed by one unsuccessful attempt to start the auxiliary power unit (APU). The procedures indicate that the flight crew should 'not wait for successful engine start(s) prior to starting [the] APU.' Additionally, the procedures noted that 'in moderate to heavy rain it may take up to 3 minutes to accelerate to idle [engine speed],' but the flight crew reported that they waited only about 1 minute between each restart attempt.",

        "Correct Answer": "The consequences of the flight crew's deviation from the Boeing 737 Operations Manual during the engine restart attempts were that the airplane descended below an overcast cloud layer at about 8,000 feet, and the crew decided to attempt to ditch the airplane into the river with flaps and landing gear retracted.",

        "Correct Answer": "The Safety Board's concerns about the validity of the current FAA certification standards for rain and hail ingestion arose from the Garuda Indonesia Airlines flight 421 accident because the accident clearly demonstrated that meteorological conditions exist that can cause engine flameout at a turbofan-powered aircraft inadvertently encountered during flight. The Board noted that the current standard is based on service and atmospheric data gathered in the 1980s and that significant technological advances in weather prediction have occurred since then.",

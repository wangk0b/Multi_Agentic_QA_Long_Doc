        "Question": "How does the frequency-dependent charge distribution affect the performance of a microstrip line at high frequencies?",
        "Correct Answer": "At high frequencies, the charge distribution on a microstrip line becomes less uniform due to the skin effect and current bunching. This results in increased resistance and inductance, which can degrade the performance by causing higher losses and reduced signal integrity.",

        "Question": "Explain the relationship between skin effect and internal conductor inductance in a microstrip line.",
        "Correct Answer": "The skin effect causes the current to be confined to the surface of the conductor at high frequencies, reducing the effective cross-sectional area through which the current flows. This increases the internal conductor inductance because the magnetic fields are more concentrated near the surface, leading to higher inductive reactance.",

        "Question": "How does dielectric dispersion influence the propagation velocity of a sinusoidal signal in a microstrip line?",
        "Correct Answer": "Dielectric dispersion causes the effective permittivity of the dielectric material to vary with frequency. As a result, the propagation velocity of a sinusoidal signal, which depends on the effective permittivity, also varies with frequency. This can lead to signal distortion and phase delay.",

        "Question": "Compare the effects of current bunching and skin effect on the charge distribution of a microstrip line at 1 GHz and 10 GHz.",
        "Correct Answer": "At 1 GHz, both current bunching and skin effect cause the charge distribution to be more concentrated near the surface of the conductor, but the effect is less pronounced compared to 10 GHz. At 10 GHz, the skin effect dominates, causing the current to be confined to an even thinner layer near the surface, leading to a higher concentration of charges and greater resistance.",

It can be mitigated by designing the transmission line with dimensions that support only the desired mode and by avoiding discontinuities that can excite higher-order modes.",

Z₀e is generally higher than Z₀o because the mutual inductance and capacitance between the lines affect the odd mode more significantly.",

        "Question": "How does the capacity of a MIMO system change if the number of transmit antennas is increased while keeping the number of receive antennas constant?",
        "Correct Answer": "The capacity of a MIMO system with high SIR scales approximately linearly with the minimum of M and N, where M is the number of transmit antennas and N is the number of receive antennas. Therefore, if the number of transmit antennas is increased while keeping the number of receive antennas constant, the capacity will increase linearly until M equals N. Beyond that point, increasing the number of transmit antennas further will not increase the capacity.",

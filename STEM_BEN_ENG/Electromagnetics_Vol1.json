The mobility of charge, which is determined by the atomic and molecular structure of the material, affects how easily charge carriers can move through the material.

In a perfect conductor, any electric field gives rise to infinite current density, which is not plausible even in the ideal limit. Instead, this condition is interpreted as meaning that \\(\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{J}/\\sigma \\rightarrow 0\\) throughout the material. A good conductor, on the other hand, has a high but finite conductivity, allowing charge to move freely within the material when an electric field is applied, creating current flow in that direction.",

This challenges the assumption that air is a good insulator because, under the right conditions (i.e., sufficiently large potential difference), air can become conductive and allow current to flow through it.",

This can be more intuitive and straightforward than working with resistances, especially in cases where the applied voltage is considered to be the independent 'stimulus' and current is considered to be the response.",

This is given by the equation \\(P = \\sigma |\\mathbf{E}|^2 dv\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is the conductivity and \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the electric field intensity.

For example, Gauss's law for electric fields and Gauss's law for magnetic fields have similar integral and differential forms. This duality helps in understanding that while electric fields are generated by static charges, magnetic fields are generated by steady currents, and it emphasizes the analogous behavior of these fields under different conditions.",

In transformers, mutual inductance allows the transfer of energy between the primary and secondary windings.

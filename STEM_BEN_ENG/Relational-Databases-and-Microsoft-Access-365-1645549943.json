        "Question": "How does the functional dependency deptCode -> deptLocn affect the normalization of the Department table, and what would be the consequences if this dependency did not exist?",
        "Correct Answer": "The functional dependency deptCode -> deptLocn ensures that each department code uniquely determines a department location, which helps in achieving normalization by eliminating redundancy and ensuring data integrity. If this dependency did not exist, it would mean that a department code could be associated with multiple locations, leading to data anomalies and redundancy.",

        "Question": "What are the implications of having deptCode as the primary key in the Department table for the functional dependencies, and how would the table structure change if deptName was also a primary key?",
        "Correct Answer": "Having deptCode as the primary key ensures that all other attributes (deptName, deptLocn, deptPhone, chairName) are functionally dependent on deptCode. If deptName was also a primary key, it would imply that deptName is unique and could be used to identify records, potentially leading to a composite key (deptCode, deptName) and changing the table structure to accommodate this new key.",

        "Question": "How does the composite key in the Course table influence the functional dependencies, and what would be the impact if courseNo was not part of the composite key?",
        "Correct Answer": "The composite key (deptCode, courseNo) in the Course table ensures that each combination of department code and course number uniquely determines the title, description, and credit hours. If courseNo was not part of the composite key, deptCode alone would not be sufficient to uniquely identify a course, leading to potential data redundancy and loss of data integrity.",

        "Correct Answer": "The functional dependencies in the Course table (deptCode, courseNo -> title, description, credit hours) ensure that the table is normalized by eliminating redundancy. If the title attribute was removed, the remaining dependencies would still hold, but the table would lose important information about the courses, potentially affecting its usability and completeness.",

If this dependency was reversed (id -> sin), it would mean that each employee ID uniquely determines a social insurance number, which could still maintain normalization but might imply a different organizational structure.",

        "Question": "What are the implications of the one-to-many relationship between Employee and Position for the functional dependencies, and how would the table structure change if the relationship was many-to-one?",
        "Correct Answer": "The one-to-many relationship between Employee and Position implies that each employee can hold at most one position, while a position can be held by many employees. This affects the functional dependencies by ensuring that employee ID determines position title. If the relationship was many-to-one, it would mean that each position is held by at most one employee, potentially changing the table structure to include position ID as a foreign key in the Employee table.",

        "Correct Answer": "The many-to-many relationship between Employee and Position with the attribute startDate implies that an employee can hold multiple positions over time, and each position can be held by multiple employees. This affects the functional dependencies by ensuring that the combination of employee ID, position ID, and startDate uniquely determines the relationship.

        "Correct Answer": "The identifying relationship between Department and Course implies that each course is uniquely identified by the combination of department code and course number, making Course a weak entity. This affects the functional dependencies by ensuring that deptCode and courseNo together determine the course attributes. If Course was not a weak entity, it would need its own unique identifier, potentially changing the table structure to include a separate course ID.",

This would lead to data redundancy and the inability to store data for persons who are neither employees nor students.",

        "Question": "How does the concept of referential integrity ensure data consistency in a relational database, and what are the potential consequences of not enforcing it?",
        "Correct Answer": "Referential integrity ensures data consistency by enforcing that a foreign key value in one table must match a primary key value in another table or be null. If referential integrity is not enforced, it can lead to orphaned records, where a foreign key value does not have a corresponding primary key value, resulting in data inconsistency.",

        "Question": "How does MS Access ensure that no two rows in a table have the same value for a field that is indexed with no duplicates?",
        "Correct Answer": "MS Access ensures that no two rows in a table have the same value for a field that is indexed with no duplicates by enforcing the unique constraint on the indexed field. When a new row is added or an existing row is updated, MS Access checks the value against the index to ensure it does not already exist. If a duplicate value is found, the operation is rejected, thereby maintaining the uniqueness of the field.",

        "Question": "Why is it important to set the Field Size property for text data in a database?",
        "Correct Answer": "Setting the Field Size property for text data in a database is important because it limits the maximum length of the text that can be entered into the field. This helps in preventing excessively long entries, reducing storage requirements, and ensuring data consistency. It also helps in improving data integrity by restricting the input to a reasonable length, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors.",

        "Question": "How would you map a multi-valued attribute in a relational database, and what are the implications for the design of the database?",
        "Correct Answer": "Each multi-valued attribute is implemented using a new relation. This relation will include the primary key of the entity type. The primary key of the new relation will be the primary key of the entity type plus the multi-valued attribute. Note that in this new relation, the attribute is no longer multi-valued.",
